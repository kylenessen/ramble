# TODO

- Implement feature that will automatically discard transcripts that have no content or are very short (less than 25 words)
- need to be careful about iPhone voice memos being uploaded to inbox folder because they are not capturing original creation date. Look in to better methods.
- Work on ways to make this easy to deploy on remote servers.
- Consider making an option to have this run on my laptop only.
- consider using m4a instead of opus.
